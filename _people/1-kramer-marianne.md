Prior to becoming a postdoctoral associate in the Slotkin lab, I received a BS in Biology from the State University of New York (SUNY) at New Paltz. I then moved to Philadelphia and completed my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the lab of Brian Gregory. During my PhD, I studied several aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation during Arabidopsis stress response, including RNA-protein interactions, RNA secondary structure, and covalent RNA modification, on a transcriptome-wide scale. I additionally examined a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA we named CONSERVED IN BRASSICA RAPA 1 (lncCOBRA1) and described its function during Arabidopsis germination and development.


In the Slotkin lab, I aim to merge my knowledge of post-transcriptional gene regulation and non-coding RNAs with Keithâ€™s expertise in RNA directed DNA methylation to better understand why certain transgenes are silenced and others escape silencing.
