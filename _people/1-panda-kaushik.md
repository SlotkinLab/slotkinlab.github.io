My journey so far:
I joined Dr. Keith Slotkin’s lab as a graduate student at The Ohio State University in 2012. Over the years I enjoyed developing and leading the bioinformatics segment of the lab and graduated with a PhD in Molecular Genetics. Towards the end of my graduate career I learned about Keith moving to the Danforth Center in St. Louis. I saw it as an opportunity to continue to work in a wonderful lab environment, and in a state-of-the-art plant research facility with a different work culture. So, I moved with Keith, literally in the same moving truck, to St. Louis. Since then I have had the opportunity to form exciting collaborations, attend unique events, and participated in the mostly-fun-sometimes-nerve-wrecking, but definitely enlightening, [Big Ideas 2.0 event](https://www.danforthcenter.org/news/a-big-idea-with-a-bigger-impact/)
 
Current projects:
Transposable elements (TEs) are fascinating genetic units which can change their location in the genome and this mechanism is leveraged to develop cutting-edge biological tools. Working with Keith, I have always had the opportunity to move beyond the current expertise in lab and explore new techniques or new frontiers in TE biology. One of the challenges of genome wide TE studies is the absence of transcriptional annotation. So, I focused primarily on using long read Oxford Nanopore cDNA sequencing to fill this gap and propel TE bioinformatics. This annotation, [is now public](https://github.com/KaushikPanda1/AthalianaTETranscripts). Additionally, I am currently working on a collaborative project to investigate chromatin accessibility and understand its correlation with TE expression. It’s an exciting time for TE biology!
 
Life outside work:
My favorite thing to do outside of work is to travel. Using the opportunity of an US visa I have travelled multiple times to South America and would love to explore Europe in future. I enjoy cooking, especially Indian cooking, and I am always up for trying out new recipes. Coincidently, I am also in a lab that believes in exploring food and for our weekly lunch we try to visit a new restaurant every two weeks.
