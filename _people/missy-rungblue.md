Missy began her career in the for-profit sector and spent 18 years there gaining knowledge and experience with budgeting, project planning, financial reporting, project management, information technology, and team leadership.  After 18 years, she decided that she wanted to take these skills to the non-profit sector because she believes that the non-profit community deserves the same knowledge and expertise in finance and operations that the for-profit sector receives.  She spent 7 years gaining a wide range of knowledge and experience by holding roles in membership management, grants management, and financial management of two St. Louis area non-profit organizations.  Knowing that she wanted to support the success of a science-based organization, Missy joined Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in January 2020.  Here she is proud to support the Center’s Principal Investigators and their work by ensuring grants submittals are successful and the post-award financial reporting and grant management provides the information PI’s need to successfully complete their research.

Missy holds an MBA from Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management from Truman State University.  She loves to read, sew, garden, and learn new things.  She and her husband enjoy going to concerts, traveling the world, and laughing at the antics of the animals in their household.  She is also the president of the Skeptical Society of St. Louis, a grassroots organization dedicated to promoting science and critical thinking in the community, and the owner/creator of b17navigator.com, a website about her father’s experience during World War II.
