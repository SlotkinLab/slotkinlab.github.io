#### The Slotkin laboratory is dedicated to diversifying biology.
#### Below are some of the Outreach & Education activities that we either lead or participate in:
----
#### [Mutant Millets outreach](https://mutantmillets.org), serving St. Louis Middle & High Schools.

Keith Slotkin is the lead-PI of this Outreach Project that is taught in ~10 schools per semester. The students grow EMS populations of Setaria and hunt for mutant plants! This project is a collaboration with the Danforth Center's amazing [Education Research and Outreach Lab](https://www.danforthcenter.org/our-work/education-outreach/) and is supported by an NSF's Understanding the Rules of Life grant.   

#### Anyone Can Be A Scientist When They Use the Scientific Method! 

This is a one-hour classroom exercise taught by Keith Slotkin suitable for Middle or High School students. It explains what a scientist does on a daily basis, and demonstrates that everyone uses aspects of the Scientific Method in their daily life (for example to fix a broken lamp). This interactive hour helps demonstrate to students that this ability is inside them, helps give that ability a voice, and proves that anyone can be a scientist, even without a fancy lab. This exercise was born out of a long term collaboration with The Ohio State [Young Scholars Program](https://odi.osu.edu/young-scholars-program).   

#### Slotkin Lab Internships from the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation's Food, Agriculture and Nutrition Innovation Center

The Danforth Center has collaborated with Team U.S.A. and local hero Jackie Joyner-Kersee and her [Foundation](https://jjkfoundation.org) to form the Food, Agriculture and Nutrition Innovation Center in East St. Louis. This exciting [new partnership was recently announced](https://www.danforthcenter.org/news/jackie-joyner-kersee-foundation-officially-launches-food-agriculture-and-nutrition-innovation-center-in-unique-public-private-partnership/). The Slotkin integrates High School interns from East St. Louis for summer research projects. 

#### Course-Based Undergraduate Research

The Slotkin lab has developed Course-Based Undergraduate Research for students to screen for stress resilient plants in populations with or without active transposable elements. We visit the classrooms and help the students with their projects. This project was most recently integrated into a biology course at Lindenwood University with the help of [Dr. Joshua Neely](https://www.lindenwood.edu/about/directories/faculty-staff-directory/details/jneely/).

#### Danforth Center Research Experience for Undergraduates
The Slotkin lab is an annual participant in this NSF-funded REU project, integrating undergraduate students into the lab for a summer full of research, training and mentoring. More on this program [here](https://www.danforthcenter.org/our-work/education-outreach/undergraduate-program/internship-program/) and [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2050394&HistoricalAwards=false). 

#### Danforth Center's Responsible Conduct in Research Committee
Keith Slotkin is a member on the Danforth Center's RCR Committee. We provide face-to-face training on best research practices, authorship, plagiarism, and other ethical traps that scientists commonly fall into. 

#### Teaching Resources
After watching too many cooking shows, I wrote an essay on how to reimagine a laboratory course:
