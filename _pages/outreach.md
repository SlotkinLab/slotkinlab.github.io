#### The Slotkin laboratory is dedicated to diversifying biology.
#### Below are some of the Outreach & Education activities that we either lead or participate in:

#### [Mutant Millets outreach](https://mutantmillets.org), serving St. Louis region Middle & High Schools.

Keith Slotkin is the lead-PI of this Outreach Project that is taught in ~10 schools per semester. The students grow EMS populations of Setaria and hunt for mutant plants! This project is a collaboration with the Danforth Center's [Education Research and Outreach Lab](https://www.danforthcenter.org/our-work/education-outreach/) and is supported by a NSF's Understanding the Rules of Life grant.   

#### Anyone Can Be A Scientist When They Use the Scientific Method! 

This is a one-hour classroom excercise taught by Keith Slotkin suitable for Middle or High School students. It explains what a scientist does on a daily basis, and demonstrates that everyone uses aspects of the Scientific Method in their daily like, for example to fix a broken lamp. This excercise helps demonstrate to students that this ability is inside them, helps give that ability a voice, and proves that anyone can be a scientist, even without a fancy lab. This exercise was born out of a long term collaboration with The Ohio State [Young Scholars Program](https://odi.osu.edu/young-scholars-program).   

#### Slotkin Lab Internships from the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation's Food, Agriculture and Nutrition Innovation Center

The Danforth Center has collaborated with Team U.S.A. hero Jackie Joyner-Kersee and her [Foundation](https://jjkfoundation.org) to form the Food, Agriculture and Nutrition Innovation Center in East St. Louis. This exciting [new partnership was recently announced](https://www.danforthcenter.org/news/jackie-joyner-kersee-foundation-officially-launches-food-agriculture-and-nutrition-innovation-center-in-unique-public-private-partnership/). The Slotkin lab will be integrating High School interns from East St. Louis for summer research projects. 

#### Course-Based Undergraduate Research

The Slotkin lab has developed Course-Based Undergraduate Reserach for students to screen for stress resilient plants in populations with or without active transposable elements. We visit the classrooms and help the students with their projects. This project was most recently integrated into a biology course at Lindenwood University with the help of [Dr. Joshua Neely](https://www.lindenwood.edu/about/directories/faculty-staff-directory/details/jneely/).
